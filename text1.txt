A graph is formed by two sets. The first set, finite and non-empty, consists of vertices. The second consists of edges or arcs. We call networks entities from natural or social phenomena that hold some relationship. Networks are represented mathematically by graphs. Imagine a network of healthcare professionals. Doctors and nurses are examples of possible vertices of this network. The connections between them can represent the occurrence of daily interaction.
